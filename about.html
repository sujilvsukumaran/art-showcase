        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sujil, an artist passionate about blending digital and traditional mediums to create evocative pieces that tell a story. My journey into the art world began at a young age, where I found solace and expression through colors and shapes.</p>
        <p>My work is inspired by the beauty of nature, the complexity of human emotions, and the ever-evolving world of technology. I strive to create art that resonates with people on a personal level, invoking memories, thoughts, and dreams.</p>
        <p>Whether it's a vibrant digital illustration or a meticulously crafted traditional painting, I aim to push the boundaries of my creativity and share a piece of my soul with the world.</p>
